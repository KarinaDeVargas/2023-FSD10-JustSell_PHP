For our website design we took inspiration from existing real-estate websites and decided on the following design.

A common Navbar containing the following:
	- Logo (goes to main home page)
	- Login (goes to User Registration & Login Page)
	- Search (goes to Search Results Page)
	- Contact us (goes to Contact us Page)

1. Home Page:
	○ Display an overview of the website, highlighting key features, offers, and search functionality.

2. User Registration & Login Page:
	○ Allow users to register or login to their accounts.

3. User Profile Page:
	○ Enable registered users to modify their profile details.

4. Accommodation Listings Page:
	○ Display a list of accommodations with essential information like address, description, listing agent, and price.

5. Accommodation Details Page:
	○ Provide detailed information about a specific accommodation, including images and additional details.
	○ Allow users to submit an offer for a particular accommodation.

6. Search Results Page:
	○ Show search results based on user input with the option to filter the results.

7. Checkout Page:
	○ Confirm the offer with the user and indicate how much it is above or below the asking price.

8. Admin Panel:
	○ Provide access to administrative functions to manage users, agents, properties, and offers.

9. Contact us Page:
	○ Information about our group/topic
	○ How to contact the company and/or where they are located

Currently our wireframes for the Home page and Admin Panel are still in progess.
